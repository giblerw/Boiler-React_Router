### Welcome, to the beginning:
- This is the most stripped down SPA I could make, intending this to serve as a boiler plate to make future React app production faster.
- This SPA toggles between three page components using react-router

#### To get started:
- Fork,
- clone,
- cd into the clone,
- $ npm install,
- $ yarn start
#### After that, you're good to go...
